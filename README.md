# hello-world
My First Repository


First repository for my pre-work Hello, I am starting this Go For Code
program here at Liberty Mutual. I am very excited to start something new in my
career here. I have worked here for almost 14 years and have worked in many
departments. I have my bachelorâ€™s degree in accounting and love working with
numbers and logic. I have been married for 14 years and have two wonderful
children that keep us busy all the time.
